### Django Banking Management System

#### What I Learned from This Project
- **Django Model Relationships**: Understanding and implementing relationships such as `OneToOne`, `ManyToOne`, and `ManyToMany` in models to effectively represent real-world data structures.
- **Django Templates**: Creating dynamic, reusable, and efficient HTML templates using Django's templating engine with features like template inheritance and filters.
- **Django Queries**: Writing efficient queries to interact with the database using Django ORM, including filtering, aggregations, and prefetching data for optimization.
- **Django Decorators**: Implementing built-in and custom decorators to manage access control and improve code reusability (e.g., `@login_required`).
- **User Authentication**: Setting up user login, registration, and session management to secure the application.
- **Error Handling and Debugging**: Debugging application issues, handling exceptions, and improving user experience with meaningful error messages.
- **Class-Based and Function-Based Views**: Understanding and implementing both paradigms for different use cases.
- **Database Migrations**: Creating and applying migrations to handle schema changes seamlessly.
- **REST API Basics (if applicable)**: Building RESTful endpoints using Django REST Framework (DRF) to expose banking data for integration with other systems (optional, based on your project).
